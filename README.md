# OpenCV/Vision/Face Detection
This is simply my attempts to build projects around opencv.
The end goal is to get comfortable to with C++ while going through a subject I find interesting.
Maybe it will benefit you in some way!

I have attempted to build this as I would build a proper C++ project. 
And would appreciate if you can figure out ways to improve the project build.

Also, I am building these projects quick and dirty, so I am building against:
1. "opencv2/opencv.hpp"
2. `pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv`

This means that my builds will be relatively bulky and time consuming.
I might rectify this situation in a future project as I get more comfortable with reading opencv documentation, the make build system and figure out a way to automate the library selection for building the individual targets.
