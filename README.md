# OpenCV/Vision/Face Detection
This is simply my attempts to build projects around opencv.
The end goal is to get comfortable to with C++ while going through a subject I find interesting.
Maybe it will benefit you in some way!

I have attempted to build this as I would build a proper C++ project. 
And would appreciate if you can figure out ways to improve the project build.

I started building these projects quick and dirty, so was building against:
1. "opencv2/opencv.hpp"
2. `pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv`

This means that my builds were relatively bulky and time consuming. I have started porting things over to the cmake but it's an ongoing process right now.
