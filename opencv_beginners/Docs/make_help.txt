The default build is debug.

In order to build in debug mode:
	make debug

In order to build in release mode:
	make release

It is possible to build the tests for each target:
	In release mode the targets start with "R"
	In debug mode the targets start with "D"

If you are looking to create a utility that reads and writes images:
	make DreadWrite - debug
	make RreadWrite - release

If, instead you want resize and cropping functions:
	make DcropResize - debug
	make RcropResize - release

To check the rotate function:
	make Drotate - debug
	make Rrotate - release
